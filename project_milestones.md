Here’s a suggested multi-phase plan that you (and Cursor) can follow to systematically implement the recommendations. Each phase focuses on a subset of improvements, with logical dependencies in mind (so that early changes provide a stable foundation for later ones).

---

## Phase 1: Centralize and Simplify Google OAuth Logic

1. **Create a dedicated “Google OAuth Manager” utility**  
   - Consolidate all token retrieval and refresh code into a single file (e.g. `lib/googleOAuthManager.ts`).
   - Move logic scattered in `lib/clerkTokenManager.ts`, `lib/googleAuth.ts`, and your route handlers (`auth/google-token`, `auth/google-reconnect`) to this single utility.
   - Expose high-level methods such as:
     - `getOrRefreshGoogleToken(userId: string): Promise<string>`  
     - `disconnectGoogle(userId: string): Promise<void>`  
     - `generateAuthUrl(sessionId: string, userId: string, reconnect?: boolean): string`  
   - Ensure that you remove any duplicate logic around generating OAuth URLs or refreshing tokens.

2. **Refactor References to the New Utility**  
   - Update your route handlers (e.g. `app/api/auth/google-token/route.ts`, `app/api-handlers/auth.ts`, etc.) to call this central utility instead of re-implementing token logic.
   - Remove or deprecate the leftover code in `lib/clerkTokenManager.ts` and `lib/googleAuth.ts` that now duplicates the new utility.

3. **Validate the Flow**  
   - Thoroughly test sign-in/out flows, token refresh flows, reconnection flows, and error handling (e.g., revoked tokens).

**Outcome**: A single, consistent code path for everything Google OAuth–related.

## Phase 2: Combine `googleDriveService` and `GoogleDriveServerService`

1. **Review Both Services**  
   - Look at `GoogleDriveServerService` (e.g. `listFiles`, `uploadFile`) and `googleDriveService` to identify the overlaps.  
   - Document what’s truly unique in each (if anything).

2. **Merge and Rename**  
   - Create a single `GoogleDriveService` that handles all logic.  
   - Decide whether you need separate client vs. server “entry points.” For Next.js 13, typically only the server side should call the real Google API. If you need a client-friendly version, you might wrap server calls with a simple fetch function in the client.

3. **Update Call Sites**  
   - Search your codebase for references to both services and systematically replace them with the new, unified `GoogleDriveService`.
   - Remove leftover or unused methods once everything is unified.

4. **Test**  
   - Confirm that listing, uploading, deleting, etc. still work as expected with the single merged service.

**Outcome**: A single, clear class or module for all Google Drive operations, drastically reducing confusion about which service to import.

## Phase 3: Break Up or Simplify the `[...slug]/route.ts`

1. **Choose a Route Organization Strategy**  
   - **Option A**: Keep `[...slug]` but make it smaller by pulling out the route definitions into separate files. Then import them into `[...slug]/route.ts`.  
   - **Option B**: Migrate to more conventional Next.js 13 approach, e.g. `api/auth/[method]/route.ts`, `api/upload/route.ts`, etc. to avoid the dynamic dispatch.

2. **Refactor**  
   - If you choose Option A, create new files or subdirectories that contain the logic for “auth” routes, “upload” routes, “delete” routes, etc.  
   - If you choose Option B, systematically move each route definition into its own file structure, removing the big `routes` object from `[...slug]/route.ts`.

3. **Adjust Imports and Testing**  
   - Make sure anywhere you called `fetch('/api/auth/session')` (or similar) still points to the correct route.  
   - Re-run your entire test suite or do some manual QA to confirm each endpoint still works.

4. **Remove Unused Code**  
   - Once everything is separated, remove any leftover references or old code paths in `[...slug]/route.ts`.

**Outcome**: A more discoverable, maintainable route structure that doesn’t require searching through a giant “catch-all” file.

## Phase 4: Introduce Shared Helpers & Improve Logging

1. **Create a Shared Auth Check Helper**  
   - For instance, `requireAuth()` in `lib/server/` that returns the `userId` or throws/returns a `NextResponse.json(401)` if not authenticated.  
   - Update all server routes to use this function instead of duplicating `const { userId } = auth(); if (!userId) ...`.

2. **Streamline Logging**  
   - Replace your many repeated “timestamp + environment check + request ID” blocks with a single logging utility, e.g. `log(level, message, data)`.  
   - Have that utility handle environment-based filtering (less verbose in production, full logs in development).

3. **Adopt a Consistent Logging Format**  
   - For example, `[timestamp][module][level] message`.  
   - Optionally, standardize JSON logs if that suits your environment.

4. **Review & Remove Excess Verbosity**  
   - If some logs are purely for debugging token issues, consider toggling them with a debug flag or removing them once you confirm reliability.

**Outcome**: More concise, consistent code thanks to shared helper functions and a refined logging approach.

---

## Phase 5: Final Polish & Testing

1. **Review and Fix Any Gaps**  
   - Double-check any leftover references to old services, routes, or partial OAuth logic.  
   - Confirm each new route or utility has adequate error handling and test coverage.

2. **Performance and Load Testing**  
   - With more centralized code, confirm your main flows can handle typical production loads.  
   - If the big logging or big route architecture is still a bottleneck, consider further tweaks.

3. **Documentation**  
   - Update `README.md`, `documentation.md`, or any relevant internal docs to reflect the new structure (e.g., “To implement OAuth, see `googleOAuthManager.ts`,” “To call Google Drive, see the unified `GoogleDriveService`,” etc.).

5. **Delete useless files**  
    - Based on ALL previous phases, find and delete any unneeded files for this new setup.

## Summary

By tackling the recommendations in a phased approach, you minimize disruption and ensure each step is stable before moving on. After Phase 4 (and a final pass in Phase 5), you’ll have:

- **One** clear place for Google OAuth logic.
- **One** unified service for Google Drive operations.
- **A** clearer route structure (less monolithic, easier to read).
- **Shared** helpers (no more re-implementing `auth()` checks).
- **Streamlined** logging (less noise, consistent format).

This will result in a more maintainable codebase that’s easier to extend and debug in the future.
